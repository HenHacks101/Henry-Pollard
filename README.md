# Poker Project
This is a project meant to simulate a poker game. The code made by using pycharm. I also used python the coding language.
To run this program you should download the files, upload it to pycharm, and then run the system. 


        Analysis
While creating a poker game in computer science using Python, I undertook a comprehensive process that encompassed several key stages.
I initiated the project by designing a simplified version of Texas Hold'em, outlining the game's scope, and planning its features.
I constructed the core game mechanics, including the deck creation, shuffling, card dealing, and managing betting rounds.
For the user interface, I developed a text-based display using print statements, enabling players to make decisions through the command line. 
I implemented a robust betting system with player chip management, pot calculations, and adherence to betting rules. 
Hand evaluation was realized through a function that analyzed player hands and community cards to determine winning combinations.
Furthermore, I introduced AI-controlled opponents with varying strategies, while extensive testing, debugging, and documentation phases ensured the game's functionality and user guidance. This project deepened my programming skills, spanning data structures, algorithms, UI design, and simulation, resulting in an engaging Python-based poker experience.
